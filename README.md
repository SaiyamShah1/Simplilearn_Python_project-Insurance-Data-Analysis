Exploratory Data Analysis and Predictive Modeling for Medical Insurance Premium Costs

# Insurance Data Analysis and Premium Prediction

## Introduction

This project involves exploratory data analysis (EDA) and predictive modeling on a dataset provided by ABC Insurance. The primary goal is to gain insights into the factors affecting medical insurance premiums and to build a model that predicts the cost of medical insurance based on various input features.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains information about policyholders and their medical insurance claims. The key features in the dataset are:

- `age`: Age of the person
- `sex`: Gender of the person (female or male)
- `bmi`: Body Mass Index, a measure of body fat based on height and weight
- `children`: Number of children covered by health insurance
- `smoker`: Smoking status of the person
- `region`: The region where the person resides (northeast, northwest, southeast, southwest)
- `charges`: The medical insurance premium charged

The dataset is available in the file `insurance.csv`.

## Project Objective

The main objective of this project is to analyze the dataset and develop a model to predict the cost of medical insurance. Specific goals include:

1. Performing exploratory data analysis to uncover patterns and relationships between the features and the insurance charges.
2. Building a predictive model using machine learning techniques to estimate insurance premiums based on the provided features.
3. Providing insights and visualizations that can help the insurance agency make better business decisions.
   
## Steps Followed

1. **Import Libraries**: Importing necessary libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and NumPy.
2. **Load Dataset**: Loading the dataset and checking its structure.
3. **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values and ensuring data quality.
4. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyzing the relationship between different features and the target variable (`charges`).
5. **Data Visualization**: Creating visualizations to illustrate the findings from the EDA.
6. **Model Building**: Developing a predictive model to estimate insurance charges.
7. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluating the model's performance using appropriate metrics.
   
## Results and Observations

- **EDA Findings**: Summary of key findings from the exploratory data analysis.
- **Model Performance**: Description of the predictive model and its evaluation metrics.

### Observations:
- Smokers tend to have higher insurance premiums compared to non-smokers.
- BMI and age are significant predictors of insurance charges.
- Visualizations showing trends and patterns in the data.
